# Flappy-Bird
HOW TO START:
Run the GameEngine class.

CONTROLS:
Use the space-bar to make the bird jump.

POWER-UPS:
1. Gravity
When the flappy bird becomes red, the gravity becomes stronger 
and you must fly faster to prevent the bird from falling. You 
can also go through the upper pipes as long as you avoid the 
"mushroom".

2. SUPER
When the flappy bird becomes blue you will gain speed and a
invincibility shield. This is an easy way to generate more 
points.

Boths power-ups are randomly generated and both have a post
power-up shield to make the transition a bit easier.
